## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-07 | The epic runs on `feat/kb-redesign`. Areas run on `feat/kb-redesign/<area>`. | User brief |
| 2026-10-07 | `.claude/settings.local.json` is created and git-ignored (`.gitignore`). | User brief |
| 2026-10-07 | The baseline runs on launch configs `redesign-api` :8110 and `redesign-web` :5184. Ports :8100 and :5174 are held by another session's servers. | Port conflict observed |
| 2026-10-07 | "Before" screenshots are JPEG q80, not PNG. The first PNG capture was 30 MB. | Repository weight |
| 2026-10-07 | `DESIGN.md` is archived as a copy. The original stays in place and governs what ships until Phase 5 replaces it. | User brief ("delete nothing"), CLAUDE.md |
| 2026-10-08 | There are no official e& guidelines or font files. Use the brief's primitives (unverified) and self-hosted `@fontsource` fonts with Arabic. | User answer |
| 2026-10-08 | The earlier e& revamp is **superseded in full**: branch `feat/ui-revamp-eand-theme` and the mock-up in `knowledge-portal-design-concept/`. Neither its visuals nor its IA count as evidence. The epic starts from `main` and this brief. The branch and its worktree are left untouched. | User answer |
| 2026-10-08 | **GATE 0 approved.** Screenshots stay in git. The Phase 1 critique covers historic records, catalogue evidence and requirement-knowledge rows as empty states only, with no fixtures. The timezone test is fixed in a separate session. | User |
| 2026-10-08 | The two tallest document-review captures (13k and 17k px) are clipped to the first 4,000 px. All "before" captures total 16 MB. | Repository weight |

## Brand source

- **The user's answer (2026-10-08):** neither official e& brand guidelines nor licensed
  typeface files are available.
  - Use the brief's primitive values. Record them as "the redesign brief, unverified against
    official guidelines" in DESIGN.md.
  - Pick a calm, self-hosted `@fontsource` pairing with Arabic coverage.
  - This matches the 2026-10-06 note that there is no e& font licence.
- **Working primitives (the brief's values, unverified against official guidelines):**

  | Primitive | Value |
  |---|---|
  | red | `#E00800` |
  | maroon | `#4B0F1E` |
  | grey | `#636363` |
  | beige | `#E6E6DC` |
  | white | `#FFFFFF` |

## Open questions (GATE 0)

Answered on 2026-10-08:

- Brand source: no guidelines and no fonts.
- The prior revamp: superseded in full.

Still open:

1. **Screenshots in git.** 106 JPEGs (16 MB) in `docs/redesign/before/` are committed, and later
   phases add more. Keep them in git, or move them to an ignored folder or an artifact store?
2. **The timezone-dependent test failure:** fix it separately (a task chip has been offered) or
   inside the epic?
3. **Phase 1 critique coverage.** Historic records, catalogue evidence and requirement-knowledge
   rows have no seeded data offline. Critique their empty states only, or add test fixtures?
   Fixtures would be frontend-only, because backend files are out of bounds.

## Next exact action

GATE 1a has two paths:

- **Run the research:** the user runs sessions with `docs/ux/research/plan.md` and adds anonymised
  notes, survey results and benchmark data to `docs/ux/research/raw/`.
- **Assumption mode:** the user says "assumption mode".

Then do Phase 1, step 3: synthesis in `docs/ux/research/synthesis.md`, built from `raw/`, or
labelled HYPOTHESIS and built from `01-heuristic-review.md` and PRODUCT.md.
